## About Me
A data science enthusiast who's exploring with data. Currently, I’m diving deep into the world of data as a Data Science Fellow at CUNY Tech Prep. Previously i experimented with AI as an AI Fellow at Cornell Tech, and honed my leetcodding skills through CodePath’s rigorous program.

I enjoy uncovering the stories hidden in datasets, whether it’s through crunching numbers, building predictive models, or just experimenting with new techniques. My journey in data science is driven by a passion for continuous learning—I’m always on the lookout for the next big thing in the field. 


When I’m not immersed in code or data, you can catch me striking yoga poses(still can't sit in Scorpion, though), getting lost in a good mystery novel, catching up on tech podcasts, or perfecting my pool game. I love exploring new ways to apply my data science skills to real-world challenges. The more I learn, the more excited I become about the endless possibilities in this field. Let’s connect and chat about data!
